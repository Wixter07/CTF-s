So this was similar to what **Easy** was. We had to click the button a number times and there's a math equation after every 10 clicks. So what's happening is for every correct solve, the number of clicks reduced by 10 and for every wrong answer, the number of clicks increased by 30. We get the flag after we get 2500 click or 250 correct answers to the equations.
Seniors used the **Photomath** app to take a picture and it gave the solution. So they did it for like 200 times and got the flag for challe **Easy**.
I also tried the same thing for Uneasy and what I noticed was, instead of lowering by 10 clicks, it lowered by 20 clicks. This is when I came to know that since the link is same for us, multiple people doing solbing those equations will finish the challenge quickly.
So I along with Rupak and Yogesh together went on solving the quesions to get the flag.
Manual Labour at its best.

The flag - `ugra_peterparker2_final_release_LASTVERSION_lyn9exv87rjs`
