So we have with us an image file.

Reverse searching it, we come to learn that it from a popular game call **Papers,Please**.

So I went through their [fandom page](https://papersplease.fandom.com/wiki/EZIC) , and came to know that there's a similar image being used to to decipher the message. I went through the day 10 tutorial of this game and the player used a decoder and overlayed it on the cipher to get the hidden message.
I used this decoder and overlayed it over the image.
