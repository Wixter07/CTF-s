# Fake Guy

Well our team first blooded this one. Was a tough one tbh.

## The Challenge

```
A guy from somewhere is pretending to be a member of our CYBERGON. He created several social media accounts by abusing our username. Some intel said he setup username by doing typo squatting. Please try to investigate and help me to track him down.

# Solve

We have info that the fuy is pretending to be a member of CYBERGON by creating several accounts by typo squatting. Let's consider it luck that I searched for `CYBERGOM_MM` instead of CYBERGON and got the [X](https://x.com/Cybergom_MM) handle.

Then I ran sherlock with the username and got these results
