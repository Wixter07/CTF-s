# A messenger 

So we have with us an image file.

Reverse searching it, we come to learn that it from a popular game call **Papers,Please**.

So I went through their [fandom page](https://papersplease.fandom.com/wiki/EZIC) , and came to know that there's a similar image being used to to decipher the message. I went through the day 10 tutorial of this game and the player used a decoder and overlayed it on the cipher to get the hidden message.
I used this decoder and overlayed it over the image.

When connecting it to the first two dots on the top, we get this as first half of the flag

On connecting to the second two dots below it, we get the second half of the flag.
