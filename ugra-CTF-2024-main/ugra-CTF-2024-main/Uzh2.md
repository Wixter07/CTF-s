Since the snake in the game was speeding up everytime we got a point, I tried slowing down the game from the emulator options but it didn't work.
So my friend Madhav tried lowering the fps to run and win the game and it worked. Sadly I didn't have the option to lower fps in **KEmulator**.
I used the android app **J2ME loader** which I used before **KEmulator** to test the gamea, and tried lowering the fps on it and plyed it as Madhav. What we need to do is win the game twice with 10 points in each to get the flag.


The flag - `ugra_it_gets_longer_954ac1`
